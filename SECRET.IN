I write software help files here.
It's fun!
If you could come and visit some time, that would be great.
You can help at proofreading.
Say hello to Dawn for me.
Later.

Hi!

I really don't know what's wrong with that boy.
I have had it up to here with him!
I mean it!
He totally doesn't know what's going on here.
I think I am going to cry.
He's got me feeling down today.
Help!

Mom is in the kitchen.
She's cooking the turkey.
Mom's first name is Wanda.
The scent of that turkey is awesome!
I really love turkey.

Hey!
Does it work?

What is it now
I know it is time to go.
I haven't finished the data yet.
I didn't have time to do it!
I'll have it for the contest, don't worry
Yes, I'll test all the cases.
It will be good data.
There are more men than women signed up.
It always seems to be that way.
More women should come to these contests.
We really have to figure out a way to get them to sign up.
I don't know the way to do it, though.
Maybe a financial aid program would help.
That's probably part of the problem.
Maybe it's just their natural tendency to avoid being a geeky programmer.
I think this country needs more female programmers anyway.
I really do!

This problem is cool.
Is this the last case?
Only the judges know for sure!
A good program will stop when it should.
Test your programs well!
